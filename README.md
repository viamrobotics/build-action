# build-action

This is a Github CI action which wraps Viam's cloud build system. Use this to build and publish your Viam module for multiple platforms.

## What is Viam cloud build?

Cloud build is cross-compilation infrastructure that we provide to module authors so you can publish your module for multiple platforms. (x86 and ARM Linux, ideally MacOS as well).

Your customers are deploying to different kinds of hardware, and prototyping on a laptop. Cloud build helps you to reach them everywhere without doing the heavy lifting of operating your own buildsystem.
